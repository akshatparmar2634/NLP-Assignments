First Citizen: Friends, before we act, let us pause for thought.
All: Speak your mind, we listen.
First Citizen: Do we not suffer every day under the weight of their greed?
All: We do, we do.
First Citizen: And yet, do they offer us relief or justice?
All: Never.
First Citizen: Shall we then endure, or rise and claim what is ours?
All: We shall rise! Rise!
Second Citizen: Hold, fellow citizens! Have we considered all sides of this matter?
First Citizen: All sides? What more is there to see? Our hunger speaks louder than any argument.
Second Citizen: Yet violence may bring only more misery. Should we not seek dialogue?
First Citizen: Dialogue with those who turn deaf ears to our pleas? No, we have waited too long.
Third Citizen: What of the gods? Might they not favor patience over wrath?
First Citizen: The gods help those who help themselves. Are we not their children, deserving of their blessing?
All: Aye, we are! Let us act!
Second Citizen: Then let our actions be measured, not reckless. Let us show we are just, not mere rebels.
First Citizen: If justice is denied, then rebellion is justice.
Third Citizen: Who comes yonder?
Second Citizen: It is Marcus. He may bring word from the council.
Marcus: Citizens, I bring news. The council meets, yet their ears are closed to your cries.
First Citizen: Then we know our course. Onward to the square!
All: To the square! To the square!
