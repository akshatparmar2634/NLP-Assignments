PETRUCHIO : Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I cannot come to woo . You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have better 'd rather than decreased : Then tell me , if I get your daughter's love , What dowry shall I have with her to wife ?
BAPTISTA : After my death the one half of my lands , And in possession twenty thousand crowns .
PETRUCHIO : And , for that dowry , I'll assure her of Her widowhood , be it that she survive me , In all my lands and leases whatsoever : Let specialties be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand .
BAPTISTA : Ay , when the special thing is well obtain'd , That is , her love ; for that is all in all .
PETRUCHIO : Why , that is nothing : for I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud-minded ; And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury : Though little fire grows great with little wind , Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all : So I to her and so she yields to me ; For I am rough and woo not like a babe .
BAPTISTA : Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed ! But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words .
PETRUCHIO : Ay , to the proof ; as mountains are for winds , That shake not , though they blow perpetually .
Re-enter HORTENSIO , with his head broke
BAPTISTA : How now , my friend ! why dost thou look so pale ?
HORTENSIO : For fear , I promise you , if I look pale .
BAPTISTA : What , will my daughter prove a good musician ?
HORTENSIO : I think she'll sooner prove a soldier Iron may hold with her , but never lutes .
BAPTISTA : Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
HORTENSIO : Why , no ; for she hath broke the lute to me . I did but tell her she mistook her frets , And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering ; When , with a most impatient devilish spirit , ' Frets , call you these ? ' quoth she ; ' I'll fume with them : ' And , with that word , she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ; And there I stood amazed for a while , As on a pillory , looking through the lute ; While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack ; with twenty such vile terms , As had she studied to misuse me so .
PETRUCHIO : Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench ; I love her ten times more than e'er I did : O , how I long to have some chat with her !
BAPTISTA : Well , go with me and be not so discomfited : Proceed in practice with my younger daughter ; She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns . Signior Petruchio , will you go with us , Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you ?
PETRUCHIO : I pray you do . I will attend her here , And woo her with some spirit when she comes . Say that she rail ; why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale : Say that she frown ; I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash'd with dew : Say she be mute and will not speak a word ; Then I'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence : If she do bid me pack , I'll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week : If she deny to wed , I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married . But here she comes ; and now , Petruchio , speak .
Enter KATHARINA
Good morrow , Kate ; for that's your name , I hear .
KATHARINA : Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing : They call me Katharina that do talk of me .
PETRUCHIO : You lie , in faith ; for you are call'd plain Kate , And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst ; But Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom Kate of Kate Hall , my super-dainty Kate , For dainties are all Kates , and therefore , Kate , Take this of me , Kate of my consolation ; Hearing thy mildness praised in every town , Thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded , Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs , Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife .
KATHARINA : Moved ! in good time : let him that moved you hither Remove you hence : I knew you at the first You were a moveable .
PETRUCHIO : Why , what's a moveable ?
KATHARINA : A join'd-stool .
PETRUCHIO : Thou hast hit it : come , sit on me .
KATHARINA : Asses are made to bear , and so are you .
PETRUCHIO : Women are made to bear , and so are you .
KATHARINA : No such jade as you , if me you mean .
PETRUCHIO : Alas ! good Kate , I will not burden thee ; For , knowing thee to be but young and light â€”
KATHARINA : Too light for such a swain as you to catch ; And yet as heavy as my weight should be .
PETRUCHIO : Should be ! should buzz .
KATHARINA : Well ta'en , and like a buzzard .
PETRUCHIO : O slow-wing'd turtle ! shall a buzzard take thee ?
KATHARINA : Ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard .
PETRUCHIO : Come , come , you wasp ; i' faith , you are too angry .
KATHARINA : If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
PETRUCHIO : My remedy is then , to pluck it out .
KATHARINA : Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
PETRUCHIO : Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? In his tail .
KATHARINA : In his tongue .
PETRUCHIO : Whose tongue ?
KATHARINA : Yours , if you talk of tails : and so farewell .
PETRUCHIO : What , with my tongue in your tail ? nay , come again , Good Kate ; I am a gentleman .
KATHARINA : That I'll try .
She strikes him
PETRUCHIO : I swear I'll cuff you , if you strike again .
KATHARINA : So may you lose your arms : If you strike me , you are no gentleman ; And if no gentleman , why then no arms .
PETRUCHIO : A herald , Kate ? O , put me in thy books !
KATHARINA : What is your crest ? a coxcomb ?
PETRUCHIO : A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen .
KATHARINA : No cock of mine ; you crow too like a craven .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , come ,
PETRUCHIO : Come , come , you wasp ; i' faith , you are too angry .
KATHARINA : If I be waspish , best beware my sting .
PETRUCHIO : My remedy is then , to pluck it out .
KATHARINA : Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies .
PETRUCHIO : Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? In his tail .
KATHARINA : In his tongue .
PETRUCHIO : Whose tongue ?
KATHARINA : Yours , if you talk of tails : and so farewell .
PETRUCHIO : What , with my tongue in your tail ? nay , come again , Good Kate ; I am a gentleman .
KATHARINA : That I'll try .
She strikes him
PETRUCHIO : I swear I'll cuff you , if you strike again .
KATHARINA : So may you lose your arms : If you strike me , you are no gentleman ; And if no gentleman , why then no arms .
PETRUCHIO : A herald , Kate ? O , put me in thy books !
KATHARINA : What is your crest ? a coxcomb ?
PETRUCHIO : A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen .
KATHARINA : No cock of mine ; you crow too like a craven .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , come , Kate , come ; you must not look so sour .
KATHARINA : It is my fashion , when I see a crab .
PETRUCHIO : Why , here's no crab ; and therefore look not sour .
KATHARINA : There is , there is .
PETRUCHIO : Then show it me .
KATHARINA : Had I a glass , I would .
PETRUCHIO : What , you mean my face ?
KATHARINA : Well aim'd of such a young one .
PETRUCHIO : Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you .
KATHARINA : Yet you are wither'd .
PETRUCHIO : 'Tis with cares .
KATHARINA : I care not .
PETRUCHIO : Nay , hear you , Kate : in sooth you scape not so .
KATHARINA : I chafe you , if I tarry : let me go .
PETRUCHIO : No , not a whit : I find you passing gentle . 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen , And now I find report a very liar ; For thou are pleasant , gamesome , passing courteous , But slow in speech , yet sweet as spring-time flowers : Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip , as angry wenches will , Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk , But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers , With gentle conference , soft and affable . Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ? O slanderous world ! Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels . O , let me see thee walk : thou dost not halt .
KATHARINA : Go , fool , and whom thou keep'st command .
PETRUCHIO : Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait ? O , be thou Dian , and let her be Kate ; And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful !
KATHARINA : Where did you study all this goodly speech ?
PETRUCHIO : It is extempore , from my mother-wit .
KATHARINA : A witty mother ! witless else her son .
PETRUCHIO : Am I not wise ?
KATHARINA : Yes ; keep you warm .
PETRUCHIO : Marry , so I mean , sweet Katharina , in thy bed : And therefore , setting all this chat aside , Thus in plain terms : your father hath consented That you shall be my wife ; your dowry 'greed on ; And , Will you , nill you , I will marry you . Now , Kate , I am a husband for your turn ; For , by this light , whereby I see thy beauty , Thy beauty , that doth make me like thee well , Thou must be married to no man but me ; For I am he am born to tame you Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates . Here comes your father : never make denial ; I must and will have Katharina to my wife .
BAPTISTA : Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ?
PETRUCHIO : How but well , sir ? how but well ? It were impossible I should speed amiss .
BAPTISTA : Why , how now , daughter Katharina ! in your dumps ?
KATHARINA : Call you me daughter ? now , I promise you You have show'd a tender fatherly regard , To wish me wed to one half lunatic ; A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack , That thinks with oaths to face the matter out .
PETRUCHIO : Father , 'tis thus : yourself and all the world , That talk'd of her , have talk'd amiss of her : If she be curst , it is for policy , For she's not froward , but modest as the dove ; She is not hot , but temperate as the morn ; For patience she will prove a second Grissel , And Roman Lucrece for her chastity : And to conclude , we have 'greed so well together , That upon Sunday is the wedding-day .
KATHARINA : I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first .
GREMIO : Hark , Petruchio ; she says she'll see thee hang'd first .
TRANIO : Is this your speeding ? nay , then , good night our part !
PETRUCHIO : Be patient , gentlemen ; I choose her for myself : If she and I be pleased , what's that to you ? 'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company . I tell you , 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me : O , the kindest Kate ! She hung about my neck ; and kiss on kiss She vied so fast , protesting oath on oath , That in a twink she won me to her love . O , you are novices ! 'tis a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew . Give me thy hand , Kate : I will unto Venice , To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day . Provide the feast , father , and bid the guests ; I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine .
BAPTISTA : I know not what to say : but give me your hands ; God send you joy , Petruchio ! 'tis a match .
GREMIO TRANIO : Amen , say we : we will be witnesses .
PETRUCHIO : Father , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu ; I will to Venice ; Sunday comes apace : We will have rings and things and fine array ; And
